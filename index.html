It was in my Grade 9 year when my views on life changed. I became tired and frustrated all the time. I wasn’t enjoying life because I felt that nothing good was happening to me. I didn’t have many friends and I didn't really have any passions either. I was just kind of drifting along.

                                                <p class="my-3 text-muted">When I got to move to Canada, I was pretty excited. I thought that to be happy, I must get out of the environment that got me tired and frustrated. I kept the same habits — sleeping too much, not working hard, constantly complaining, etc. It also took me a long time to talk to people. I kept quiet throughout school, wishing desperately for someone to talk to me as I was too afraid to talk to them first. I worried that they may not like me for who I am.</p>
                                                <p class="my-3 text-muted">This school year, however, I figured something out. What if I just stopped caring as much and just do what makes me happy? What are the true downsides of making that perfectly timed joke in front of the classmate I’m not close to? There actually are none. Eventually, I broke out of my shell and started to do what makes me happy. I started telling more jokes. I talked to people I thought were cool. I went out more. I helped more people. To be completely honest, I initially felt like all these were incredibly draining. I always felt tired after each conversation and needed time to myself. But during those times I spent by myself, I found that this balance was what I needed to make me 10x happier.</p>
                                                <p class="my-3 text-muted">I reflected on my own actions and found that the reason why I’m much happier now, is because I put in the work to keep in touch with friends. I actively find ways to help people. I worked on projects that I find interesting. I worked for those good things to happen to me.</p>
                                                <p class="my-3 text-muted">Now I believe that happiness is a choice and happiness takes a lot of hard work. Nothing good comes easily, even happiness. To truly be happy, I must take control of my own actions instead of waiting for good things to happen to me.</p>

After my own personal experiences, I believe that we should choose to educate. Sometimes, but not always, they people are not aware that what they had said was offensive. The best way to handle this is to tell them simply what they did was wrong. Hopefully, they’ll learn and apologize.</p>
                                                <p class="my-3 text-muted">And if they don’t? Well, I think there are two ways to handle this.</p>
                                                <p class="my-3 text-muted">1. Simply walk away. Sometimes, people just don’t have access to the same information and perspective as you. Eventually, they will learn and grow on their own.</p>
                                                <p class="my-3 text-muted">2. Not everyone you meet might be open to this but breakdown the thought process that led them to think this way. By understanding their perspective, you might be able to get them to understand your perspective too.</p>
                                                <p class="my-3 text-muted">However, not everyone learns. That is okay. They may never feel guilty for hurting you. But it is still up to you to decide if you want to hold your anger in or forgive. You can be angry but don’t let that anger eat you up for too long. Learn how to move on.</p>

                                                <p class="my-3 text-muted">I grew up very privileged. I never worried about my next meal, having clothes to wear, or access to wifi. I never really thought about how big of a deal that was until I was in fifth grade. I went with my school, accompanied by my dad, to Cambodia. While I was there, I worked with an orphanage to help paint their school, teach the students English as well as organize fun games to play. As a school, we also went out to the slums near landfills to give out food to the families living there. That experience was etched into my memory. It sparked my love for philanthropy and giving back to those in need.</p>
                                                <p class="my-3 text-muted">While I can go on to talk about how many people I’ve “helped”, I’d rather talk about how recognizing my privilege helped push me to do more. I think recognizing how lucky I really give me so much perspective.</p>
                                                <p class="my-3 text-muted">My dad was a refugee from Vietnam. He’s been through a lot when he was younger. He had to travel on a small boat for days, sleep on a beach and ration food just so he can make it to Canada. On top of that, he had to work multiple jobs while in college so he can bring the rest of his family to Canada. Just by comparing my journey to Canada with my dad’s, it really showed me how hard someone has to work to break out of the poverty cycle.</p>
                                                <p class="my-3 text-muted">Once you know how lucky you are and how hard the people before you had to work to give you this life, you will feel the urge and desire to help others and hopefully provide them with the same opportunities as you.</p>

                                                <p class="text-muted">On social media, Instagram more so, we see posts like “Self Care to help with Anxiety/Depression” with them listing things like face masks, bath bombs, and recommending Netflix shows to watch. The truth is, this form of “self-care” is actually feeding to consumerism and is literally just instant gratification which does nothing to help with anxiety or depression.</p>

                                                <p class="my-3 text-muted">Sure face masks and bath bombs can make you feel good at that moment, but if you have piles of assignments to do, your future self will not feel as good. When looking at self-care, it is important to find a balance. Yes, having a good ol’ face mask is very relaxing but using it as your sole coping mechanism is not healthy at all.</p>
                                                <p class="my-3 text-muted">As difficult as this sounds, sometimes the best way to care for yourself is to finish the project that you’ve been procrastinating on or getting up to wash those dishes in the sink.</p>

                                                <p class="my-3 text-muted">When someone is working a minimum wage job, what happens when they feel sick? They still go to work. They need the money, they cannot afford to miss a day of work. Missing a day’s worth of pay means missing a day’s worth of food, toiletries, rent. Just with a day, they can lose so much just by taking a day off. Eventually, working constantly while physically sick takes a toll on their mental health. They feel drained, frustrated with nothing to turn to. They can’t go see a therapist. They would have to take a day off and they can’t afford it either. They just have to keep going. They have to rely on fast food, chips, and other unhealthy foods to feed themselves. These are affordable and tasty. This can lead to long term health problems like obesity, diabetes, and high cholesterol.</p>
                                                <p class="my-3 text-muted">On the other hand, when someone who works a white-collar job falls sick, they call in sick and work from home. In most cases, they will still have food to eat, proper healthcare, and money for rent.</p>
                                                <p class="my-3 text-muted">Money cannot buy happiness applies to people only when they have reached a certain income bracket. But for those living off of minimum wage, money can buy them the time they need to be happy and lead a healthier, longer life.</p>

                                                <div class="px-md-5 px-3 py-4 quotation">
                                                <p class="my-3 text-muted">The debate around sexualization versus objectification has been going around for a while. It is not easy to differentiate the two so hopefully, this helps. Sexualization is when you look at someone in a sexual manner and objectification is when you limit a person to their sexuality. So how would that work? An example of sexualization is when you look at someone who is particularly attractive and you think to yourself, </p>

						<p class="my-3 text-muted">On the other hand, objectification is when you look at someone attractive and think,</p>
						<h6 class="base-color font-italic mb-0">‘Wow, they are good looking. I want to smash them.’</h6>
                                                </div>
                                                <p class="my-3 text-muted">When you say that someone is good-looking, you are simply acknowledging that one aspect of who they are without disregarding that they could also be smart, funny or kind. However, when you are saying that they are good-looking and because of that you want to smash them, you are degrading them to just their sex.</p>
                                                <p class="my-3 text-muted">So why is this important? The distinction between the two is important especially when it comes to sex workers or people who work in the sex industry. Since these people sell their sex as part of their job, people immediately come to assume that their sex is who they are. Because of this, many of these sex workers get harassed regularly. Just because someone sexualizes themself doesn’t mean it gives you the right to objectify them. When you harass a sex worker, they are not asking for it because sex is ‘part of their job’. Sex may be what they are selling but it is not who they are and by assuming so, you are degrading them to their sex disregarding the fact that they are also a human with feelings that require consent.</p

						     <p class="text-muted">In 3rd Grade, I joined the Girl’s Brigade which is basically girl’s scouts but the uniform is blue. I went on my first ever trip overseas without my parents to Borneo with my school mates. This was the first time I traveled overseas without my parents. During the trip, I went on my first zipline, I visited animal sanctuaries and water parks in Borneo.</p>
							 <h6 class="base-color font-italic mb-0"> 5th Grade </h6>
						    <p class="my-3 text-muted">5th grade was an exciting year for me. I spent my June break in Malaysia having the time of my life exploring waterfalls, ziplining, abseiling. It was so much fun.
I also spent my November in New Zealand as part of my school’s immersion program. I went to Aukland and visited the Hobbit town. I made friends in the New Zealand school that I visited.
At the end of the year, soon after the New Zealand trip, I went to Phnom Penh in Cambodia to volunteer with my school at an orphanage. I had a lot of fun with the kids at the orphanage, playing with cats and organizing activities with them. That is the trip that inspired me to continue giving back to the community and pursuing philanthropy.</p>
							 <h6 class="base-color font-italic mb-0">6th Grade</h6>
						    <p class="my-3 text-muted">I went back to Phnom Penh to help with the kids in Cambodia. This time, I gathered my classmates to design personalized notebooks to raise funds for the orphanage in Cambodia. We were able to raise enough funds to buy them new mattresses, books, and stationery.</p>
							 <h6 class="base-color font-italic mb-0">7th Grade</h6>
						    <p class="my-3 text-muted">My school and I went to Loola in Indonesia. We visited the orphanage that we were planning on raising funds for and had a lot of fun getting to know the kids. We also went trekking, boom-netting, kayaking. We went back towards the end of the year with our newly raised funds and supplies. We helped to paint their houses and organize activities with them to play with.</p>
							 <h6 class="base-color font-italic mb-0">8th Grade</h6>
						    <p class="my-3 text-muted">I went to Tioman Island with my school and luck for my class, we got our own small resort to ourselves. We had been separated from the rest of the cohort in our mini cloud of fun. We had a lot of fun playing volleyball, swinging from a rope, playing in the ocean. We even trekked for 2 days, camped in the middle of the forest before kayaking for 2 hours to our resort.</p>
